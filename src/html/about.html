            <h2> BRIEF HISTORY OF OGUNMODEDE SENIOR COLLEGE </h2>
            <p>Ogunmodede Senior college , situated at 39,Ekundayo Street Oloja Estate, was founded in the year 1980. The schools objective approach to education led to instant recognition by the relevant authorities and stakeholders in education in Nigeria. <br>
                <br>

            For over four decades, we have consistently turned out students who have gone on to lead different organsiations and government parastatals. Our curriculum is fit-for-purpose, coompetency-based and integrated and embedded within the current educational system and its exisiting schools but focuses on providing career-ready skills as an option for students who may have otherwise have pursued the pure academic part. <br>
          
            <br>
            Over the years, our curriculum has evolved to accommodate programmes that meet national requirement. The school presently prepares students for  examinations at various levels and the Senior School Certificate Examination such as WASSCE and NECO Exams. Equally ,we encourage our students to pick up 21st century skills and it is one of those encouragement that led to the creation of this website by the members of our programming club.

            <p> Over the course of the past decades and especially in recent years, we have maintained giant strides in contributing our quota to the nation's educational system.<br> <br>
                In 2020, our students had a 90% pass rate in the WASSCE examinations.  We went a step further in 2021, securing a 92% pass rate in the same examinations
             ultimately contributing to Educational District  III emerging as the district with the highest pass rate in the state and southwest region. <br><BR>
            
            In 2022, our students outdid themselves , placing a state-high 93.8% pass rate in the examination. To lend credence to their extraordinary performance, nine of our students as underlisted were recipients of the BYINKS foundation scholarship sposnored by the former first lady of Lagos and wife of the current Minister of Works and Housing- Mrs Abimbola Fashola.  </p>

            <p>
                The journey started from the grassroot level of Lagos State School’s Debate Season 12. My Name is Mekuleyi Success Ruth Ibukunola Opeyemi, I participated in Lagos State School’s Debate last year. I competed at the grassroot level twice and came first at both rounds. So cause we did execellently well, I and my partner Immagbediong  Emmanuel Ebunola were chosen to represent the Local Government at the District Level we also came first, so we are representing the District at the State Level.<br><br> The popular adage that says the higher you go the tougher it becomes was applicable. We had to go to our District Headquater at least three times in a week, some time we got stucked in Lagos Traffic for hours. We didn’t have to pay for the transport cause Lagos Model College Igbonla that is in Epe was chosen for the Senior Category while our school was for the Junior then. So we do go for practice together at our District. We competed at the Semi Finals and came first but the Final weren’t that easy but God helped us and we came first. The District celebrated us, we took pictures with the Tutor General Permanent Sectary Education District III.<br>
                <br>
                Months later we were informed that we will be representing the state at the national level. Wow, another oppurtunity to shine. This one was much more taugher than the ones we’ve participated in. we have also speak for 5minutes and rebult for debate. We came third at the National level and had dinner with the Commisioner of Education of Lagos State. During all of my debate I was the President of Safe Space Girls Club. I was able to get an award during the closure of the programe cause of the competitions I won and because I was able to build my confidence. Confidence is one word that we treat  during our constant gatherings.<br><br> The programme was mainly for girls that have been denied their right or are unable to stand and speak or advocate for themselves and their friends that are suffering. The programme is also aimed at helping school know their problems and how to  takle them. The programme was  also sponsored by ACTION AID NIGERIA.
